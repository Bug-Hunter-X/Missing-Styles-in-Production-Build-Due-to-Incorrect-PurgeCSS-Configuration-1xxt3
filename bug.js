This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js and involves incorrect purging of CSS classes during the build process.  This results in missing styles or unexpected rendering issues, especially after refactoring components or updating dependencies. The issue is not immediately apparent as it only manifests in production builds. During development, the styles will typically render correctly because of the hot-reload behavior that skips the purgeCSS step.
